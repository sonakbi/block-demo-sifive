## Summary
This demo project files are copied from block-pio-sifive files at first.
and modified for similar to the ddr4 on-boarding environment.

They have 3 interfaces, 2 port AXI and 1 port APB as I knew.
We don't have ddr4 ctl and phy verilog code, so we are using pwm and pio model 
instead of DDR4 verilog files as below figure.
